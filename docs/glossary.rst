   cartesian coordinates
      The "standard" coordinate system that (in 2D) uses two variables :math:`(x, y)`
      to address a point in space. Can be thought of as going
      *"along the corridor and up the stairs"*. See :ref:`math_cartesian_coordinates`

   polar coordinates
      An alternate coordinate system that (in 2D) uses two variables :math:`(r, \theta)`
      to address a point in space. Useful for curves and circular objects.

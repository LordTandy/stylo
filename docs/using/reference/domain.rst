Domains
=======

In mathematics one of the most important parts of a function definition is the
:term:`domain` it is the description of *where* the function's rule is taking
place. The rule :math:`\frac{1}{x}` is well behaved on the interval
:math:`[1, 2]` but not so on the interval :math:`[-1, 1]`.

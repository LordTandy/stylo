Reference
=========

Welcome to the reference documentation! Here you will find the nitty gritty documentation
on each and every object and function in :code:`stylo`. Most of this documentation is
automatically generated from the codebase so you might have to refer to some of the
higher level documentation to get the appropriate context for some of the stuff here.

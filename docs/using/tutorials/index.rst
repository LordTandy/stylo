Tutorials
=========

Welcome to the tutorial section! Here you should find guides to get you up to
speed on nearly every aspect of stylo (at least once they've been written).

Completely new to stylo and just want to get started? Then be sure to check out
the `Getting Started <getting-started.html>`_ guide!

Introduction to Stylo
---------------------

To start with the two most important objects to get to know are
:code:`Drawables` and :code:`Images` so here we have two relatively independent
tutorial paths that you can follow that should help you get to grips with
both of these.

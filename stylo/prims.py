    where:

    - :math:`(x_0, y_0)` is the center of the ellipse
    - :math:`a` is known as the semi major axis, larger values make the
      ellipse more elongated in the :math:`x`-direction
    - :math:`b` is known as the semi minor axis, larger values make the
      ellipse more elongated in the :math:`y`-direction
    - :math:`r` is the "radius" of the ellipse and controls the overall
      size of the ellipse

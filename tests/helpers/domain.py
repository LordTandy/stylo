class BaseDomainTest:
    """A base class to be used when testing domains.

    When creating your test case to test your :class:`Domain` implementation
    if you set declare it as follows

    .. code-block:: python

       from unittest import TestCase
       from tests.helpers.domain import BaseDomainTest

       class TestMyDomain(TestCase, BaseDomainTest):
           ...

    Also if you define an implementation of the :code:`setUp` method to
    set the :code:`domain` attribute on your class to be an instance of your
    domain implementation. For example

    .. code-block:: python

       class TestMyDomain(TestCase, BaseDomainTest):

           def setUp(self):
               self.domain = MyDomain()

    Then your class will be automatically tested to see if it conforms to the
    expected behavior of :code:`Domain` objects. This will allow you to focus
    on testing the aspects of the domain that are unique to your implementation.
